In this repository you can find the code for my first "big" project from when I was writing my batchelor thesis. 
It is run using sh run.sh and runs the simulation of the 2D Ising model with meshes of different dimensions.
There are two algorithms available which are the Metropolis algorithm and the Wolff Cluster algorithm. The choice of these can be done inside the main.cpp.
